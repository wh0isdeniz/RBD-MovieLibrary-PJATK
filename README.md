# RBD-PROJECT-PJATK

This project was given during the Relational Databases (RBD) classes at PJATK. The goal was to create an ERD diagram, define the business and functional requirements (in formal language without using technical terms), and then transform them into an SQL script to create an Oracle database. The task also involved populating the database with data and writing basic queries to fulfill the requirements.

Note: I'm sharing this project as an example. I received a high grade for it, but itâ€™s not optimal and was done solely for class. There are some small issues in the SQL project and ERD diagram.
